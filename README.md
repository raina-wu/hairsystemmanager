# Maya Hair System Manager
The tool is used to facilitate the management of multiple hair systems in a Maya scene.
I wrote this tool to make my life easier when working on shot files where many hair systems exists.

## Usage
- Copy `hairsystemmanager` folder into your maya script folder
- Run the script below, and the UI will show up.
```python
import hairsystemmanager
hairsystemmanager.show()
```
